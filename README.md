# About 👋
Hello there! I'm Yang, a web developer based in the lovely city of Kaohsiung, Taiwan. I'm currently working on improving my skills and gaining professional experience to prepare myself for college, and my career afterwards.

# Skills 🛠️
- Frontend: React.js, Vue.js, MUI, TailwindCSS
- Backend: Node.js, Java Spring Boot, SQL (primarily H2, PostgreSQL), Firebase, Supabase
- Web 3.0: Wagmi, Web3.js
- Miscellaneous: Figma, Git, Bitbucket, Jira

# Personal details 💾
My hobbies are:
- Drawing (I'm still learning so I haven't drawn anything but lines, squares, circles and cubes—it's surprisingly fun, though!)
- Martial arts (Taekwondo & BJJ)
- Reading (history & funny British books)
- And of course, programming

My favorite books are:
- Triumph Forsaken: The Vietnam War, 1954-1965
- All of P.G. Wodehouse's works
- Israel: A History

> Side note 🗒️: My commit chart has been a little sparse lately, as I have been working on some projects in Bitbucket.
